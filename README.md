Tips and tricks

In this game, you only can move up, down, left, or right. And each time you move, all tiles on the board will move following that direction as far as it possible. In case there are lots of cards can combine at once, they also do so. For this reason, let's think carefully about the location of tiles after you move. Of course, when you are too familiar with this game, the time to make a decision is very quick.

Tips 2: Don't chase large tiles

The fact that it is very difficult to resist temptation and chase the larger cupcakes tiles on the board to combine them. However, in order to beat this game, you need to avoid this. Remember that this action always puts you in a worse position than a better one. The thing you should do is to focus on combining the smaller cupcakes. Do this continuously and all the cupcakes always meet up at some point.

Tip 3: Move toward the corners.

One of the wisest strategies when playing 2048 games is staying in the corners. This strategy can assure you have more of the main game board to bring in new tiles. So, let's move your tiles toward the corners to combine the new cupcakes.

Tip 4: Plan ahead

Tip 5: Slow down and think

Besides that, when you make a wrong move, don't worry because this game gives you lots of opportunities to recover as long as you have empty spaces on the board.

Tip 6: Try to combine as many cupcakes as possible

Lots of times you will come across an instance where you can merge multiple cupcakes in only one move. Don't ignore these opportunities. Even when you have two opportunities. One is the ability to combine many lower Kcal cupcakes and the rest one is the opportunity to combine two cupcakes that have very high Kcal, don't hesitate to choose to combine many lower Kcal cupcakes.
